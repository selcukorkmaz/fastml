\title{Explain the fastml_model (Only DALEX + SHAP + Permutation-based VI)}
\usage{
\method{explain}{fastml_model}(
  object,
  method = "dalex",
  features = NULL,
  grid_size = 20,
  shap_sample = 5,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{fastml_model} object.}

\item{method}{Currently only \code{"dalex"} is supported.}

\item{features}{Character vector of feature names for partial dependence (model profiles). Default NULL.}

\item{grid_size}{Number of grid points for partial dependence. Default 20.}

\item{shap_sample}{Integer number of observations from processed training data to compute SHAP values for. Default 5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not currently used).}
}
\value{
Prints DALEX explanations: variable importance table & plot, model profiles (if any), SHAP table & summary plot.
}
\description{
Provides model explainability using DALEX only. This function:
- Creates a DALEX explainer.
- Computes permutation-based variable importance with boxplots showing variability, displays the table and plot.
- Computes partial dependency-like model profiles if `features` are provided.
- Computes Shapley values (SHAP) for a sample of the training observations, displays the SHAP table,
  and plots a summary bar chart of mean(|SHAP value|) per feature. For classification, it shows separate bars for each class.
}
\details{
The bars in the variable importance plot start at the RMSE value for the model on the original data (x-axis),
and the length of each bar corresponds to the RMSE loss after permutations.
Boxplots show how random permutations differ, indicating stability.

For SHAP:
- We use the individual SHAP values from `predict_parts(..., type="shap")`.
- We aggregate mean absolute SHAP values by feature (and by class if classification).
- Class names are taken from the model predictions (the 'label' column if available).
- We print the SHAP table and then produce a summary plot similar to the provided example.
