\usage{
\method{summary}{fastml_model}(
  object,
  sort_metric = NULL,
  plot = TRUE,
  combined_roc = TRUE,
  notes = "",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{fastml_model}.}

\item{sort_metric}{The metric to sort by. Default uses optimized metric.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, produce bar plot, ROC curves (for binary classification),
confusion matrix (classification), calibration plot (classification if probabilities),
and residual plots (regression).}

\item{combined_roc}{Logical. If TRUE, combined ROC plot; else separate ROC plots.}

\item{notes}{User-defined commentary.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
Prints summary and plots if requested.
}
\description{
Provides a concise, user-friendly summary of model performances.
For classification:
- Shows Accuracy, F1 Score, Kappa, Precision, ROC AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity.
- Produces a bar plot of these metrics.
- Shows ROC curves for binary classification.
- Displays a confusion matrix and a calibration plot if probabilities are available.
}
\details{
For regression:
- Shows RMSE, R-squared, and MAE.
- Produces a bar plot of these metrics.
- Displays residual diagnostics (truth vs predicted, residual distribution).

Additionally, this version fixes a warning from RColorBrewer:
If the number of ROC curves is less than 3, we still request at least 3 colors from `brewer.pal`
and then select the needed number of colors. This avoids the warning:
"minimal value for n is 3, returning requested palette with 3 different levels".
