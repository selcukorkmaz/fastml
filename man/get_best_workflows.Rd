\title{Get Best Workflows}
\usage{
get_best_workflows(models, best_model_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A nested list of model workflows. Each element should correspond to an algorithm and contain sublists keyed by engine names.}

\item{best_model_name}{A named character vector where the names represent algorithm names and the values represent the chosen best engine for each algorithm.}
}
\value{
A named list (class \code{list}) of workflow objects corresponding to the best
engine for each algorithm. Elements are named \code{"algorithm (engine)"} and
may be \code{NULL} when a matching workflow is not found.
}
\description{
Extracts the best workflows from a nested list of model workflows based on the provided best model names.
}
\details{
The function iterates over each element in \code{best_model_name} and attempts to extract the corresponding workflow from \code{models} using the specified engine. If the workflow for an algorithm-engine pair is not found, a warning is issued and \code{NULL} is returned for that entry.
}
