Description: Provides an architecturally enforced framework for training and evaluating machine learning models 
  under strict resampling isolation. The package implements guarded resampling, ensuring that all preprocessing, 
  model fitting, and evaluation steps are re-estimated independently within each resampling split, thereby preventing 
  common forms of data leakage. fastml supports grouped and nested cross-validation, integrates with established modeling 
  engines in the 'tidymodels' ecosystem, and produces reliable performance estimates by construction rather than by convention.
